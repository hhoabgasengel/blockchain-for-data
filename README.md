# blockchain-for-data

Python-Project

This project establishes a blockchain that is meant to store big data files. All blockchains that I found cannot store data files like videos with several MB or even GB. This blockchain, which I call data-blockchain, is able (or will be able) to do that. 

There are two problems to solve here: a) create the data-blockchain itself and b) create a distribution method based on peer-to-peer.

First I downloaded a simple blockchain in Python from github. This sourcecode can be found in the branch "original blockchain program".
